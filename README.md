## Example Low-Hanging Fruit Issues

### 1. Fix typo in README.md
There is a typo in the README.md file where "FreelanceFLow" is written instead of "FreelanceFlow" in the title.

### 2. Add validation for empty job titles
The job creation form in the web app does not validate empty job titles. This should show an error message when the user tries to submit a job with an empty title.

### 3. Improve error handling in auth routes
The authentication routes in the backend could have better error messages for different failure cases (e.g., invalid credentials, account not found, etc.).
